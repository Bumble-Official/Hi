                                You can normally find me at the Bakery, or slightly above the MLP area!! 
                              I'm sat with friends most of the time, but always feel free to interact with me!! 
                  I rarely add DNIUF or DNIUC to my name, but on the rare occasions that I do, I will not interact whatso ever.
                                I follow basic DNI criteria, but PLEASE, PLEASE, don't be fuckin' weird ya'll.
